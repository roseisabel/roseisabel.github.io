### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2, was my favorite lab of the semester because the code my lab partner and I wrote generated a fun, interactive guessing game between the terminal and the user. The guessing game consisted of many if and if-else statements. I was able to write an if-else statement to determine whether the user’s guess was equal to the secret, and if it wasn’t, to print that the guess was either too high or too low.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1, was my second favorite lab because the instructions were to write a Mad Libs program, and I find those very entertaining to play and now write. Early in the semester, we created a different Mad Libs game, which was also fun, but the difference in this lab was that we validated user input. I was able to write input validation statements using the command line vector to determine whether the required number of words were given, and if they weren't, I supplied an error message.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2, would have to be my third favorite lab of the semester because it was interesting to see how loops could print many symbols in a precise manner with only a few loop statements. In this lab, we wrote counter-controlled for loops to make this possible. I was able to write a counter-controlled for loop to print a block of symbols until our counter reached 22.
